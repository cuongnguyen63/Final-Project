Hello, my name is Cuong Nguyen. This is my final project to complete the course in Coder School and it's about happiness and factors influencing happiness across countries. 
We all know that happiness is an abstract concept, but now it has become something that can be measured as an indicator of how well a country performs in terms of well-being and success. By learning the trends and figures of happiness globally and regionally, this project might provide the key insights into what makes a happy country and the correlation between government policies and happiness.
